# How to Run the Script

1. Put all the student notebook files into the `assignment_1/notebooks` folder.
2. To run the autograder script, run `py assignment_1/autograde.py`. 
3. The grades will be saved in a CSV file within the assignment subfolder.

Note:
Each notebook is converted into a single `py` scripts, so cells that fail to evaluate will cause a runtime error for the whole notebook and will be skipped.
