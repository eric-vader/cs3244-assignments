# How to Run the Script

1. Put all the student notebook files into the `assignment_X/notebooks` folder.
2. To run the autograder script, run `py assignment_X/autograde.py`. 
3. The grades will be saved in a CSV file within the assignment subfolder.

TODO:
1. Update Assignment Task 3.2 input format to be same as Task 3.1 
2. Clearly state functions must only use parameters, and not global variables
