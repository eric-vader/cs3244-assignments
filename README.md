# How to Run the Script

1. Put all the student notebook files into the `assignment_X/notebooks` folder.
2. To run the autograder script, run `py assignment_X/autograde.py`. 
3. The grades will be saved in a CSV file within the assignment subfolder.

Issues:
1. Update Assignment 1 Task 3.2 input format to be same as Task 3.1 
3. For A2, give better public cases & Instructions:
    - Tie-Breaker for Part 2
    - n_unique_class maybe > actual unique classes
4. Change submission names to not include name, since Canvas already provides
5. Add Time Limit Error
6. Assignment 2 Task 1.2 Update test case groupings
